# test-docker

Test-Docker is a Research Project for Bimodal. It's stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/leoblanc/test-docker). Documentation is available on the "docs" directory.

It's a proof of concept to show how execute multiple containers in the same CircleCi build and run tests against them (see .circleci subdirectory)

See [using-multiple-docker-images](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-multiple-docker-images)
